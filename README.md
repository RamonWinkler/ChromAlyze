# ChromAlyze

## Description
The scope of the project is to develop a solution to address the high costs and mortality associated with **Coronary Heart Disease**.
Our solution will be in the form of a web application that provides personalised recommendations in the form of a personalised report aimed at improving individual factors correlated with increased risk of **Coronary Heart Disease**. We aim to provide personalised lifestyle changes to improve your own health.

## Roadmap
Version 1.0 of ChromAlyze will be available to the public by the end of 2024. Further enhancements and integrations are planned for 2025. 
Stay tuned for updates.

## Development
A machine learning model was trained on a subset of the original Framingham data to produce a risk prediction. Several machine learning algorithms were benchmarked. To address the imbalance of the target variable, a weighted score was invented to find a balance between different performance metrics. Our trained model was integrated into a cuvette application. The application provides personalised health recommendations. The recommendations are further refined by using an open source LLM.
